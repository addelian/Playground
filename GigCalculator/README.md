This calculator is based loosely off of a tip calculator, with modified calculations to fit the indicated inputs. 

As a jazz drummer, I am often approached about performances ("gigs") with very little advance notice. As I accepted more gigs around the area, I realized that I was beginning to lose track of how much money I was actually making (or had the potential to make) at each gig. To help facilitate a well-informed decision in pursuing a gig or not, I began logging the venue locations and average payout of each performance and used that information to build this calculator.

The premise of the calculator is to determine how much I might expect to make at a local venue if I were to accept a gig, assuming I knew a little bit of background information about the gig ahead of time (namely, the weekday of the performance, how many people with which I am playing, and how much money in tips I ancitipate the group to receive). 

The calculator accepts three different inputs - "Venue," "Tip amount," and "Number of People." Tip amount is entirely optional (assumed zero if no input), and number of people defaults to "one" if no input is given. The Venue is a dropdown of multiple locations along with the relevant weekday, which sometimes affects payment at local jazz gigs (especially at the Des Moines jazz club Noce).

Certain elements of the calculator do not display until the projected payment is actually calculated, and the only way to "break" the calculator is to put in words instead of numbers. This only "breaks" it so much as it returns "$NaN" instead of a number, and as soon as the fields are updated with numerical values, the calculator works again.
